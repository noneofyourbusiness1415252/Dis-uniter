A website that displays info about your bot. Set it up quickly by running in shell (accessed through commands tab on mobile):

```bash
sed -i '/^\s*client.login(/s/^\s/require("replit-dis-uniter")(client);\n/' *.js
```

And add your repl's website to https://freshping.io (now that replit-hosted pingers are dead). [Here](https://626110f0-d408-475b-9830-1d15b93582e1.id.repl.co) is a website of a bot kept alive by this package
